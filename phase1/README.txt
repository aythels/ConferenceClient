To run the program, we have created some existing uses in App.java:
1. Run main in App.java.
2. Press enter to continue.
3. Enter Username and password of prexisiting users provided for testing.
4. UI will walk you through the rest.

Note: Due to the limited time, our ui is buggy and only contains the bare minimum but we have the necessary
controller functions for implementing all phase 1 functionality.
